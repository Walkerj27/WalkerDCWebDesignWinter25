            <h1>Polar Bears</h1>
            <h3><em>Introduction</em></h3>
            <p>Since I was young, my favorite animal to see at the zoo 
                was the polar bears. A lot of the time they were sleeping 
                because we would go in the summers when it was hot outside. 
                Sometimes, though, the polar bears would be swimming around 
                or fighting each other and overall being very active. 
                These days were always the best and it made them the most 
                fun to watch.

            <h3><em>Location and Habitat</em></h3>
            <p>Polar bears are primarily located in the arctic area 
                in and near the countries of Canada, Russia, Norway,
                and more. They also are on the ocean's ice for most of 
                time as they do many things there including hunting and 
                resting. The habitat these mammals have in slowly diminishing 
                though as climate change in melting the ice resulting in a 
                smaller area for them to live.

            <h3><em>Hunting for Food</em></h3>
            <p>Typically, polar bears will hunt for ringed and bearded seals along with fish at other times.
                Polar bears require the fat from the seals for their body to 
                to help keep them warm in their cold habitat. Also polar bears 
                are fully dependent on the sea ice in the Arctic for hunting. 
                Seals create small holes in the ice to dive below to search 
                for their food. Polar bears use these holes to find seals and will 
                hunt for the seals once they rise above the ice. Polar bears will also 
                hunt for seals when the seals are sleeping and will pounce once they 
                have an opportunity. The best time for the bears to hunt is often the 
                springtime.</p>
