        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Hello and Welcome. My name is Jack Walker and I am 
            here to tell you a little more about myself. I am 16 years old 
            and I live with my mom, my dad, and occasionally my sister, but 
            she is at college during the winter and spring. I play basketball 
            and golf as sports and as hobbies in my free time. I have been 
            playing golf for about 5 years and basketball for about 7 years. 
            Before this I had played soccer since I was 4 years old. I am an 
            easy going person for the most part and stick to doing the things I 
            like to do. Lastly, I like to spend lots of time with my family and 
            friends as those are the people closest to me.</p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basketball</strong></li>
                Basketball is a fun sport to watch, especially college basketball, 
                and it is also very fun to play.

                <li><strong>Football</strong></li>
                Football is my favorite sport to watch as it is very exciting even 
                though I don't play it.

                <li><strong>Golf</strong></li>
                Golf is a relaxing sport to watch and it is easy to have it on in 
                the background while you are doing other things since it is very long.
