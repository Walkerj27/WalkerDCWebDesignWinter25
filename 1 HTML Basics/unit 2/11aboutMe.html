        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
        <p>Hello and Welcome. My name is Jack Walker and I am 
            here to tell you a little more about myself. I am 16 years old 
            and I live with my mom, my dad, and occasionally my sister, but 
            she is at college during the winter and spring. I play basketball 
            and golf as sports and as hobbies in my free time. I have been 
            playing golf for about 5 years and basketball for about 7 years. 
            Before this I had played soccer since I was 4 years old. I am an 
            easy going person for the most part and stick to doing the things I 
            like to do. Lastly, I like to spend lots of time with my family and 
            friends as those are the people closest to me.</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basketball</strong></li>
                <p>Basketball is a fun sport to watch, especially college basketball, 
                and it is also very fun to play. </p>

                <li><strong>Football</strong></li>
                <p>Football is my favorite sport to watch as it is very exciting even 
                though I don't play it.</p>

                <li><strong>Golf</strong></li>
                <p>Golf is a relaxing sport to watch and it is easy to have it on in 
                the background while you are doing other things since it is very long.

            <ol>
                <li><a href = "https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/africa/egypt/cairo/">
                    Egypt</a></li>
                <p>I have always wanted to visit Egypt for the many 
                    ancient Egyptian structures that were created.</p>
                    <img src = "imgs/egpyt pyramids.jpg" height = "200px">
                <li><a href = "https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/europe/norway/">
                    Norway</a></li>
                <p>Norway has some of the best landscapes and mountain views 
                    in the world, so it would be a great place to visit.</p>
                    <img src = "imgs/tromso norway image.jpg" height = "200px">
                <li><a href = "https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/europe/iceland/">
                    Iceland</a></li>
                <p>Similarly to Norway, it has some amazing views and the 
                    glacier ice would be cool to see.</p>

                <li><a href = "https://www.michigan.org/city/glen-arbor">Glen Arbor</a></li>
                <p>Me and my family go here every year and I'm always excited to go 
                    back for the many great things there.</p>

                <li><a href = "https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm">Utah</a></li>
                <p>Utah has 5 national parks each with great aspects, but I want to 
                    visit Zion National Park for the many canyons and mountains that 
                    can be seen.</p>
