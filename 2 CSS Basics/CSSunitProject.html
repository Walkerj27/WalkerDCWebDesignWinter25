    <h2 id="start">How I got Started</h2>
    <p id="pstart">I fished for the first time when I was eight with
        my dad, my grandpa, and one of my grandpa's friends. We went out early 
        in the morning and caught a lot of fish which was way more than we 
        had expected. After this outing, we had started to do this every 
        year. Eventually, I started fishing in the ponds nearby with my friends 
        and we would ride are bikes their and stay for hours. After this we 
        never stopped and would go very often in the summer. </p>
