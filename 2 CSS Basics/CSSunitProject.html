    <h1>My Favorite Hobby is Fishing</h1>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>I fished for the first time when I was eight with
            my dad, my grandpa, and one of my grandpa's friends. We went out early
            in the morning and caught a lot of fish which was way more than we
            had expected. After this outing, we had started to do this every
            year. Eventually, I started fishing in the ponds nearby with my friends
            and we would ride are bikes their and stay for hours. After this we
            never stopped and would go very often in the summer. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="start">How I got Started</h2>
    <div class="box2">
        <p> Usually when I go fishing, I will fish for
            largemouth bass, catfish, or carp. For ponds, these three species
            are quite common and they are the most fun to fish for. They can be found
            in many different parts of Michigan and other states too. There are many
            other kinds of fish in the Great Lakes like musky, sturgeon, lake trout,
            and many other kinds of bass. These are the best fish to go for as they usually
            will be the most fun to catch and the biggest.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="species">Fish Species</h2>
    <div class="box3">
        <p>Like stated earlier, largemouth bass, carp, and catfish will be
            the most common fish to try and catch. Along with these three,
            bluegill can be common too for new fishermen to help them learn to fish.
            Firstly, largemouth bass will ahve the most variety. They will bite
            a lot of different rigs, but it just depends on the conditions for that
            day. For example, if the water is muddy and it is a windy day then white
            lures will be the best as the will shine in the murky water. Carp love
            to bite corn or bread and they are the most active on the bottom of the
            pond during hot, sunny days. Lastly, catfish primarily bite shad or bluegill
            and these will usually be frozen before use.
        </p>

    <h2 id="bait">Certain Baits for Certain Fish</h2>
    <div class="box4">
        <ol>
            <li>Soft Plastic Baits
                <ul>Soft plastics include senkos, bugs, and lizards. They
                    are so versatile on a bass hook because there are so many
                    ways you can rig them. A wacky rig and texas rig are usually
                    the most commonly used, but there are many other that work just as
                    well.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Frogs
                <ul>Frogs are the best topwater lures out there. They are
                    versatile and there are a few different ways to throw
                    them out.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Spinnerbaits
                <ul>Spinnerbaits are always a great go-to as they can be used in a lot of
                    different situations and are quite reliable.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Crankbaits
                <ul>There are lipped crankbaits and others with no lip. They both
                    are very good, but the lipped crankbaits are the better choice for
                    the most part. They can be fished at many different depths too.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Jigs
                <ul>There are so many types of jigs that work in certain scenarios
                    that they had to make the list. There is always a jig for any situation
                    that will work well.</ul>
            </li>
