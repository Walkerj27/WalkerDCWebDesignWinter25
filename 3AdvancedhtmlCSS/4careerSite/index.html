    <h1>Data Scientist: The Study of Data Sets </h1>
    <h2>Data science falls into the use of computer science, statistics,
        and mathematics </h2>
    <p> I am interested in being a data scientist because the overall
        work associated with the job fascinates me. Data science involes
        statistics, mathematics, and computer science. All of these
        interest me as I really enjoy statistics like in sports and I excel
        at math in school. Computer science also involves coding and programming
        which I find to be a lot of fun.
