        <h2>The Regular Season</h2>
        <article>
            <p> The regular season is the first section of the college
                basketball season. Most teams will have their first game
                at the start of November. The regular season is a period where
                each team will play about thirty games to decide their rankings
                for the bracket and the conference tournament, but can also a period
                where developing teams have time to build chemistry and figure out
                their style of play.

        <h2>Conference Tournaments</h2>
        <article>
            <p> Conference tournaments are technically part of the regular 
                season, but they have such a large impact that they deserve 
                a separate section. Conference tournaments include all of the 
                teams in one conference to battle for an automatic bid into the NCAA 
                Tournament. The seeding is based on the conference record of each team 
                throughtout their conference play this season. The top four teams get two 
                byes and the next four teams get a single bye. The conference 
                tournament is so important for many teams because it gives them a chance at 
                the tournament even if they played badly this year.

        <h2>NCAA Tournament</h2>
        <article>
            <p> The final part of the season is the NCAA Tournament where 
                64 teams are competing for a national championship. The tournament 
                includes 6 rounds of a bracket where each team will face an opponent 
                from their region before moving on. There are four regions in the bracket. 
                The four regions are South, Midwest, East, and West. Each region has 16 
                teams that will battle for one spot in the final four. The winner of the 
                entire bracket is then crowned the national champions.
