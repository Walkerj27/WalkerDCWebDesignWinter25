        <p>Magic Johnson and Steph Curry are considered the two best point guards 
            of all time. Steph Curry is cut as the superior scorer on all levels while 
            Magic is one of the best playmakers the league has ever seen. Starting off with 
            champshionships, Magic has won one more than Curry, but he never won a chip without 
            Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who is the third best player on this list. Magic also was 
            never the primary scorer on his team like Curry was every year for the Warriors. 
            Offensively, Curry is a much better scorer while Magic is a better playmaker, but 
            Steph is the best 3 point shooter ever shattering records that will stand for a long time. 
            Magic, while a great playmaker, cannot compete with this level of offensive dominance. Lastly, 
            Curry has revolutionized the game with his 3 point shooting which will change the game 
            forever due to his impact.
