        <p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is recognized as a legendary NBA player.
            Yet, many argue that Stephen Curry has an even bigger impact
            on basketball today when you look at his overall influence,
            efficiency, and revolutionary changes to the game. Curry's
            performance shines in key areas like points per minute,
            offensive rating, and scoring during playoffs, often matching
            or surpassing Kareem. He’s also known for being an excellent
            playmaker with more assists per game. Curry's exceptional skill
            in shooting three-pointers—hitting 42.3% in regular games and
            39.7% in playoffs—has transformed the game. This accomplishment
            has shifted basketball strategies, changed how players position
            themselves on the court, and influenced training methods for
            players at all levels. Although Kareem boasts more
            championships (6 versus Curry's 4) and MVP awards
            (6 to Curry's 2), his style did not revolutionize the
            game in the same way Curry's has. Moreover, Kareem achieved
            his six championships with strong teammates, winning 5
            alongside Magic Johnson and 1 with Oscar Robertson. Curry,
            however, has redefined the potential for guards and sparked a
            new era focused on perimeter dominance. His legacy goes beyond
            his personal success, leaving a lasting impact on the way
            basketball is played today.
