        <p class="title">Is Stephen Curry a Top 3 Player of All Time</p>
        <p>Many opinions vary, but the top 10 we are using is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lebron James</li>
            <li>Michael Jordan</li>
            <li>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</li>
            <li>Shaquille O'Neal</li>
            <li>Tim Duncan</li>
            <li>Magic Johnson</li>
            <li>Kobe Bryant</li>
            <li>Steph Curry</li>
            <li>Kevin Durant</li>
            <li>Larry Bird</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Where Steph is ranked at #8. But if you look deeper, you will 
            see he could be a lot higher.
        </p>
        <p> The main areas to look at are: Team Success and Individual Player Stats</p>

        <p class="big"> At #7 is Kobe Bryant</p>
        <img class="bryant" src="kobe vs teph.png" height="200px" width="360px">
        <p>Kobe Bryant and Steph Curry are both offensively strong guards that can 
            score the ball at all 3 levels. While Kobe is a great player, stats 
            show that Curry is a clear cut favorite above Kobe. While Kobe has one more 
            championship than Curry, he won three of them with Shaquille O'Neal who is 
            the fourth best player on our list. Curry also won two of his with Kevin Durant 
            showing that both players won championships with great players and 2 without a 
            solid team. Next, Steph beats Kobe in offensive scoring. They average about 
            the same points per game, but Curry has a lot better efficiency shown through 
            points per minute, field goal percentage, offensive ratings,
            and having a lower free throws per game. Lastly, Curry has more MVPs than kobe 
            which rounds out his better individual and team success.

        <p class="big"> At #6 is Magic Johnson</p>
        <img class="johnson" src="steph vs magic.png" height="200px" width="360px">
        <p>Magic Johnson and Steph Curry are considered the two best point guards 
            of all time. Steph Curry is cut as the superior scorer on all levels while 
            Magic is one of the best playmakers the league has ever seen. Starting off with 
            champshionships, Magic has won one more than Curry, but he never won a chip without 
            Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who is the third best player on this list. Magic also was 
            never the primary scorer on his team like Curry was every year for the Warriors. 
            Offensively, Curry is a much better scorer while Magic is a better playmaker, but 
            Steph is the best 3 point shooter ever shattering records that will stand for a long time. 
            Magic, while a great playmaker, cannot compete with this level of offensive dominance. Lastly, 
            Curry has revolutionized the game with his 3 point shooting which will change the game 
            forever due to his impact.

        <p class="big"> At #5 is Tim Duncan:</p>
        <img class="duncan" src="Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 07-54-58 Steph Curry and Tim Duncan.pdf.png"
        height="200px" width="360px">
        <p>Tim Duncan is a defensive forward while Steph is an offensive guard, 
            so it is not too easy to compare their stats. Starting off, Steph averages 
            0.73 points per minute which is the 4th highest of all time meaning 
            he is the fourth most efficient scorer as this stat measures efficiency. 
            Steph also does this while averaging 4.4 free throws per game compared to 7.7 
            for Duncan which is about 2-3 less points per game. Steph also has double the 
            assists per game that Duncan has showing he contributes on multiple different parts 
            of the offense. Tim Duncan still beats Steph on most defensive and rebounding stats 
            as that is the main part of his game. Although Duncan has great defense, he has never won 
            Defense Player of the Year which is the best defensive accolade while Steph has won 
            two scoring titles throughout his career for his offensive abilities. These two may 
            be hard to compare with their different physicals and skillsets, but looking at the 
            stats shows Steph was better at his role than Duncan was at his.
