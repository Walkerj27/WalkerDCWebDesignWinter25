        <p>Shaquille O'Neal was the most dominant center in the history of the
            league while, as we know, Steph Curry is the most dominant long range
            shooter. Looking at the stats, Stephen Curry has the edge over Shaquille
            O’Neal in several important ways, showing his effectiveness and modern
            influence. Curry scores more points per game in both the regular season
            and playoffs. He also excels in assists, offensive rating, and
            especially in three-point shooting, where his 42.3% accuracy in the
            regular season is much better than Shaq's 4.5%. While Shaq was
            excellent at controlling the area around the basket and getting
            rebounds, Curry's offensive rating is higher at 118.2 compared to Shaq’s
            104. Curry's skills in shooting and creating plays for his team make him
            very influential, especially in today's game, which tends to focus on
            outside shooting and spreading the defense.
