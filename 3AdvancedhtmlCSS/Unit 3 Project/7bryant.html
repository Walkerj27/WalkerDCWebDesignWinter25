        <p>Kobe Bryant and Steph Curry are both offensively strong guards that can 
            score the ball at all 3 levels. While Kobe is a great player, stats 
            show that Curry is a clear cut favorite above Kobe. While Kobe has one more 
            championship than Curry, he won three of them with Shaquille O'Neal who is 
            the fourth best player on our list. Curry also won two of his with Kevin Durant 
            showing that both players won championships with great players and 2 without a 
            solid team. Next, Steph beats Kobe in offensive scoring. They average about 
            the same points per game, but Curry has a lot better efficiency shown through 
            points per minute, field goal percentage, offensive ratings,
            and having a lower free throws per game. Lastly, Curry has more MVPs than kobe 
            which rounds out his better individual and team success.
