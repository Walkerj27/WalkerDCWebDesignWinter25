        <p>Tim Duncan is a defensive forward while Steph is an offensive guard,
            so it is not too easy to compare their stats. Starting off, Steph averages
            0.73 points per minute which is the 4th highest of all time meaning
            he is the fourth most efficient scorer as this stat measures efficiency.
            Steph also does this while averaging 4.4 free throws per game compared to 7.7
            for Duncan which is about 2-3 less points per game. Steph also has double the
            assists per game that Duncan has showing he contributes on multiple different parts
            of the offense. Tim Duncan still beats Steph on most defensive and rebounding stats
            as that is the main part of his game. Although Duncan has great defense, he has never won
            Defense Player of the Year which is the best defensive accolade while Steph has won
            two scoring titles throughout his career for his offensive abilities. These two may
            be hard to compare with their different physicals and skillsets, but looking at the
            stats shows Steph was better at his role than Duncan was at his.
